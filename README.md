#Guessing Game

This is just a hobby project of mine. I just want to explore the Python Tkinter and  how to make the gui .py file into executable one.

The mechanics of this game is very simple; The user may enter a number between 1-10 then if he/she got the correct secret number a pop up message box will display a 'Congratulations'
If the entered number was close to the correct secret number (meaning its greater than or less than 2 from the correct answer), it will display a 'Close Guess'.
If the user entered a character or any simple, it will display  an error  message box that says 'Invalid Input'
Then a Restart Button; if the user clicked the restart button, the counting of attempts will go back from 0.
